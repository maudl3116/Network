Title: This package can be used to perform Inference on Exponential Random Graph Models.
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Natalia Garcia Martin & Maud Lemercier
Description: This package allows to perform inference on ERGMs. 
    For noisy data arising from a Bernoulli graph model, inference (on the noise parameters (true positives and false positives) and the single parameter of the Bernoulli model) is conducted via the Expectation Maximisation algorithm.
    For complete data arising from more complex ERGM models (with more than one sufficient statistics) bayesian inference is conducted via enhanced Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. Namely the Exchange and the Double Metropolis-Hastings algorithms
